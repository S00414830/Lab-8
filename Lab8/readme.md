## Executive Summary 
This week assignment included various database models and allowed the opportunity to practice querying a database with SQL. Furthermore,this section discussed key ethical and legal implications of information systems.

## Data, Information and Knowledge
### Compare and contrast data, information and knowledge
In comparing and contrasting data, information and knowledge it is important to understand data is the raw facts and maybe qualitative (descriptive) or quantitative (numeric). Whereby information is processed data that has context, relevance and purpose and information involves the manipulation of raw data to obtain an indication of magnitude, trends, in patterns in the data for purpose. And knowledge is the area of human believes or perceptions about relationships among facts or concepts relevant to that area. In addition there is explicit knowledge that typically refers to knowledge that can be expressed into words or numbers and tacit knowledge includes insights and intuition that is difficult to transfer to another. And the final step to knowledge is wisdom; this is when a person combines their knowledge and experience to produce a deeper meaning to a topic.

### Relational Data
When creating a database for a small company and two tables you identify are: customers and orders, explained below is the primary key, relationship between customer and orders and foreign key.  The Customer table would include customer Id, Customer name,contact name,address, city, postal code and country.  And the second table customer order would include customer ID, customer name, order date, order number,order name, order unit and price.

#### Primary Key
The primary key would be Customer id that is unique to both the customer and orders for each table in a relational database.

#### Relationship between customers and orders
The relationship between the customers and orders would be the primary key Customer ID. 

#### Foreign key of orders table
And possible a foreign key in this example would be an Order number.

### Field Data Types

### Big Data
When defining fields in a database table it is important to give each field data a type. The reason this is important is because the data field type defines what functions can be performed and it also gives the field the proper amount of storage space. The field types are: Text: for storing non-numeric data that is brief, generally under 256 characters. The database designer can identify the maximum length of the text, number: for storing numbers. There are usually a few different number types that can be selected, depending on how large the largest number will be,Boolean: a data type with only two possible values, such as 0 or 1, “true” or “false”, “yes” or “no”,Date/Time: a special form of the number data type that can be interpreted as a number or a time,Currency: a special form of the number data type that formats all values with a currency indicator and two decimal places,Paragraph Text: this data type allows for text longer than 256 characters and object: this data type allows for the storage of data that cannot be entered via keyboard, such as an image or a music file.
